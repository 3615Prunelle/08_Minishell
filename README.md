# Description
🎉 Welcome to our Minishell ! 🎉  
Take a sit, grab a drink, and be ready to have the time of your life !  
But before anything, you may wonder ...
> **What on Earth is a Minishell ?!**

Well my friend, believe it if you want : a Minishell is ...  
A  
MINI  
SHELL  

Yup. You read it right.  
Yup. We did that.  
Impressive isn't it ?  
Yeah we know, we're pretty proud of it actually !

And here we are, noboby reads these README files but somehow I'm gonna put a ridiculous amount of time into it. Go figure.

**So what's the goal of this project, apart from _almost perfectly_ miming the behavior of a shell ?**  
The main answer is : that was a phenomenal opportunity for us to learn how a shell works under the hood, and consequently learning tons of cool commands that we ended up coding !  
That was an intense and amazing team work experience that we divided in two strategical sections :
* **Parsing** (handled by Leon)
* **Execution** (mostly handled by Sophie - Leon came to the rescue when it got time-critical though)

_Required official description, just in case :_  
Minishell is a 42 project where you build your own simplified version of bash from scratch in C.  
The goal: Understand how a shell actually works under the hood - parsing commands, handling processes, managing file descriptors, dealing with signals, and all that low-level stuff.

# Instructions
If you're here, you already know the drill : git clone, make, enjoy ! And ... That's pretty much it !  
If you're an evaluator : Please have mercy on us - We're both on pace 24 and I'm a few hours away from the Black Hole

_Required official intructions, just in case :_
### Compilation
Run `make` to compile the project.

### Execution
./minishell

# Resources
For this project, we used ...
* Google / Youtube / AI and all that jazz, obviously
* Bash as a reference, and all the manuals for authorized functions
* VSCode & GDB to code & debug
* Valgrind & Fsanitize for mem leaks
* Wait, should we actually list all the tools we used during 3 months of research here ? 😅

So what about AI ? You bet ! We spent hours having fascinating exchanges with these, all along the project, but in a smart way.
Here's an idea of the prompts we used :
* Teach me the basics of _that_ new concept and _this_ function
* I'm stuck. Here's my code - help me to find out the solution by myself, by just giving me hints
* Don't provide any answers
* What can I do with the 3 eggs, 2 apples, corn flour and butter I have at home ? - WHOOPS, wrong copy-paste.

However guess what ?! We _(almost)_ didn't use AI for this README * Insert here a sunglasses emoji *

# Additional sections
Do we need an additional section ?  
If you're out of imagination, here's a list of commands to start having the time of your life with our Minishell :

> * export HERO=Spiderman
> * echo No one has ever seen $USER and $HERO in the same room
> * env | grep MAIL
> * wc -l < sources/main.c
> * grep potato << end
> * cd ../..
> * pwd > BadassFile
> * ls -S >> BadassFile
> * sort < BadassFile
> * ls -la | grep o | wc -l
> * cat BadassFile | sort | tail -5
> * pwd | grep e | wc -m
> * echo Courgette | cat -e > Another_BadassFile
> * cat BadassFile Another_BadassFile > There

Useful tips :
> * Ctrl-C displays a new line with a new prompt
> * Ctrl-D quits minishell

Voilà, we wish you a safe journey aboard, au revoir ! Bon voyage !
